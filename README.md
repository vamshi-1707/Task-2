# Superstore Sales Data Visualization

This project showcases a data visualization and storytelling exercise using Tableau and the Sample Superstore dataset. It is part of a Data Analyst Internship task aimed at turning raw sales data into actionable business insights.

##  Objective

Reveal key trends and business insights through interactive charts and dashboards that explore:

- Sales performance by category and sub-category
- Regional profit analysis
- Customer segment performance
- Sales trends over time

##  Tools Used

- Tableau Public (for visualizations and dashboard creation)
- Microsoft PowerPoint (for storyboard presentation)
- CSV dataset: `Sample - Superstore.csv`

##  Contents

- `Sample - Superstore.csv` â€“ Dataset used for analysis
- `Superstore_Storyboard_Template.pptx` â€“ Storyboard presentation
- `dashboard_screenshots/` â€“ Screenshots of Tableau dashboard (not included here)
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview

##  Key Visuals

- **Sales by Category and Sub-Category**: Identifies top-performing product lines
- **Profit by Region**: Highlights regional performance imbalances
- **Customer Segment Distribution**: Shows which segments drive the most revenue
- **Sales Trend Over Time**: Tracks overall business growth and dips

##  Key Takeaways

- ðŸ“Œ *Technology* leads all categories in sales
- ðŸ“Œ The *South* region has high sales but low profit â€” a red flag
- ðŸ“Œ The *Consumer* segment drives the majority of revenue
- ðŸ“Œ Q2 typically shows dips â€” marketing focus may help stabilize it

## â–¶ How to Run

1. Open Tableau
2. Import `Sample - Superstore.csv`
3. Recreate the charts as per storyboard
4. Assemble into a dashboard or export screenshots for presentation

##  What I Learned

- How to choose the right charts for different business questions
- Best practices in dashboard design and visual storytelling
- Data storytelling is about **insight**, not just aesthetics
